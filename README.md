# Project-Sweeper

Project Sweeper is a collection of tools that allow a user to quickly and accurately remove the following clutter from Revit projects:
  line styles
  line patterns
  text styles
  fill region types and
  fill patterns.
Except for text styles, these items are not checked by Revit's "Purge Unused" command. Project Sweeper goes beyond just checking for unused styles and patterns. 
It also allows a user to convert from one style\pattern to another, delete all the elements using a style\pattern and to preview all the views\elements using a 
style\pattern before removing it.

Refer to html_help_files.zip for detailed description of what each command does.

Make sure you also download the project "pkhCommon_strongNamed", it has utility functions that this project uses.
